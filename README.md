brute force puzzle box solver

Hack to solve a wooden puzzle I got as a gift. Gave up on solving it manually and resorted to this brute force java hack.

I honestly don't remember why I wrote this in Java. Wrong tool for the job. Whatever, it works.

Should be straight forward to enter the pieces of any M*N*O sized puzzle and get it solved.
